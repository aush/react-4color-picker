# React 4 Color Picker
Demo: http://codepen.io/aush/pen/dGQeaW

The problem: properties of the `td` element cannot be transitioned, so in order to archive the desired effect, something different had to be done.

This module is more like a demonstration of one of the possible ways to implements this functionality, though, you're free to use this component however you want if you like it.
`npm install --save react-center`
